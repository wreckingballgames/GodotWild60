# GodotWild60
My project for Godot Wild Jam 60. The brainstorming folder is an Obsidian vault. I've been learning game dev and programming stuff on and off for years, but this is my first game! Doing is the only way to really learn, or so they say.

I will be sharing devlogs of my process on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmUS6Mn76aGRC-NcJzFr-Q).

The game will be available on my [itch.io page](https://wreckingballgames.itch.io/) and under the [Godot Wild Jam](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-60).

FOR COLLABORATORS:

I am using Godot 4.1.1 on Linux. I plan to use the Compatibility renderer and export native builds of the final game for all platforms along with the web version. (Godot 4 apparently does not support Mac with its web builds and Godot Wild requires the game to work on all platforms.)

If it isn't obvious, my first game has very hacky code and was completed procedurally with very little planning before writing or altering code. I tried my best to organize it well and refactor when I saw room for improvement. I think it's best not to dwell on this project and instead think about how to do better on the next.)
