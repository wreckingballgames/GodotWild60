# GodotWild60
My project for Godot Wild Jam 60. The brainstorming folder is an Obsidian vault. I've been learning game dev and programming stuff on and off for years, but this is my first game! Doing is the only way to really learn, or so they say.

I will be sharing devlogs of my process on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmUS6Mn76aGRC-NcJzFr-Q).

FOR COLLABORATORS:

I am using Godot 4.1.1 on Linux. I plan to use the Compatibility renderer and export native builds of the final game for all platforms. Apparently Godot 4 does not do web export correctly so this will be necessary to submit properly.
